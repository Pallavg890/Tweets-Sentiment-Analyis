# **Sentiment Analysis on Tweets**

This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis application built using the Sentiment140 dataset. The model classifies tweets as **Positive** or **Negative**, and the application is deployed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (or any other chosen framework).

## **Project Overview**

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using machine learning techniques. The Sentiment140 dataset is preprocessed and used to train a classification model. The final application provides a user-friendly interface for predicting the sentiment of user-provided tweets.

---

## **Dataset**

- **Source**: [Sentiment140 Dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/)
- **Description**: The dataset contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as:
  - **0**: Negative sentiment
  - **4**: Positive sentiment

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Tweets were cleaned of special characters, URLs, and stopwords.
  - Labels were adjusted to binary format (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive).

---

## **Features**

- **Model**:
  - Logistic Regression (or any classifier youâ€™ve used).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Text vectorization using TF-IDF.
- **Interface**:
  - User-friendly web app to input custom tweets and get predictions.

---


## **Usage**

### Run the Web Application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Predict Sentiment via Script:
You can also use the model directly:
```python
import pickle

# Load the model and vectorizer
with open("model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
with open("vectorizer.pkl", "rb") as f:
    vectorizer = pickle.load(f)

# Predict sentiment
tweet = "I love this!"
features = vectorizer.transform([tweet])
sentiment = model.predict(features)
print("Sentiment:", "Positive" if sentiment[0] == 1 else "Negative")
```

---

## **Deployment**

### Streamlit (Local Deployment)
Run the app locally:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Streamlit Cloud
1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Deploy it on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

---

## **Future Work**

- Implement support for neutral sentiment classification.
- Add visualizations for tweet sentiment trends.
- Deploy on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.
